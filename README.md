# viisi-script

## Description

Our fifth challenge revolved around the writing of the javascript to go with the html and css that was provided with us to create a password generator. The generator had to offer a series of prompts surrounding what characters to include and how many before providing a random password between 8 and 128 characters. It was completed by using a math.random and math.floor, in order to randomise a decimal and round it down and applying this to the specified character arrays for the specific lengths.
